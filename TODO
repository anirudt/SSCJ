1. Apply given MMSE.m to the original BPSK without spreading, and see if you get close to the original figure, applying the channel as well.
   The Equalizer is taking care of the Synchronization part as well
2. We are assuming we have already estimated the channel variables
  rec_data : ch_coeff * data_from_t
  imp_res : ch_coeff
  sigma_seq : variance of the noise sequence
